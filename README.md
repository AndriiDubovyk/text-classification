A GUI that not only allows the user to effectively use the system with trained models that are trained on the AG News Dataset, but also to train the system on their own files, save the training results and use it further. Already pre-trained models are loaded immediately upon launching the application.

At the top of the program window there are elements related to training, saving and loading the user's model. The flags “Train NB”, “Train SVM”, “Train RNN” are responsible for which models will be trained. The "Train" button opens a dialog box that allows you to choose a directory with text documents (txt, pdf or docx) for training, then the process of training the selected models starts. After training, the approximate value of the classification accuracy (arithmetic average of all used models on the training data set) will be shown in the dialog box. It is worth noting that the text documents in the selected directory must be placed properly - each document must be located in a subdirectory whose name corresponds to the specified text category. The "Save" button allows you to save the model in one of the computer directories, and the "Load" button allows you to load a previously saved model. The text “Categories: [list of categories]” shows which categories the model currently in use can recognize.

Next is a group of GUI elements related to uploading documents for classification. It is possible to choose the language of the provided texts, which is necessary for correct classification. By default, the English language is used, but there is an opportunity to choose Ukrainian, in which case all the user's selected texts will be automatically translated through Google Translate into English before the model predicts their category. This allows you not to train the model anew for another language, but to use the same model for recognizing texts in languages other than English. Documents for classification are selected in the dialog box that appears after clicking “Select Files”. The full path to the selected files is displayed in the corresponding text field.

The last group of interface elements is responsible for the classification itself, and the system parameters used in it. The “NB Weight”, “SVM Weight”, “RNN Weight” fields allow you to adjust the influence of each individual model on the overall result. The “Detailed Results” check box affects the format of the results display”, if it is checked, the percentage value of belonging to the categories will be indicated for each document, if not - only one most likely category (without the percentage value). The "Submit" button starts the category definition process, and "Copy Results" allows you to quickly and conveniently copy the results to the clipboard.
